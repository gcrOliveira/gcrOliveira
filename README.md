### Greetings!
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I'm Gultembergue, a mechanical engineer looking for a career shift to the Dev World! I've worked mostly with science and math focused progamming languages and have already begun the shift to more commonly used ones by learning <strong>C#, Javascript, html and css and associated frameworks</strong> with the goal of becoming a fullstack web developer. I'm always seeking growth and improvement by constantly learning and applying my knowledge to real world problems. 
</div>

##### Here's some things I wish to do:
- Improve my skills as a developer
- Work on different projects and learn about the best practices of each language
- Learn more about the best cutting edge technologies used in the workplace

If you can help me with those through a job opportunity don't hesitate to send me an email!
